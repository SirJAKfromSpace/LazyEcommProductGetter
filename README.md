# LazyEcommProductGetter
#### A python scraper that collects products lists from an ecommerce website.
- Basically it scraped a sitemap for a category listing.
- Browsed every page of each category and acquired a long long list of product links
- Then finally scraped through every product page from those links for the info
- A bunch of error handling and null conditionals had to setup so the scraper could continue collecting despite the horrid state and super random missing data of the unmentioned ecomm site
